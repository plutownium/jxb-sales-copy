			<BigWhite

			<p>
				Before you invest <span class="underline">your money and your time</span> in this guide…
			</p>
			<p>You should really know that:</p>
			<CheckmarkEntry text="You want to spend 40 hours a week writing software at a computer." />
			<p>
				Yes, software developers often do only ten hours of real work in a week. The rest is
				meetings.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it’s still WAY better than working at McDonalds, or being a career waiter, or being a
				barista.
			</p>
			<CheckmarkEntry text="You want to bust your ass learning to write code." />
			<p>
				Software development isn’t for everyone, primarily because <span class="underline"
					>learning</span

				to be a software developer is <span class="italics">hard</span>. Some people
				<span class="italics">can’t cut it.</span>
			</p>
			<CheckmarkEntry
				text="You should be someone who is confident they can meet an intellectual and creative problem solving challenge over and over."

			<p>

			<p>This guide is designed to help you KILL IT at learning to code.</p>
			<p>
				We wrote this guide because we knew that <span class="bolded"
					>every self taught developer would face the same questions</span
				>.
			</p>
			<p>We know they will face these questions because...</p>
			<p>(a) We faced these challenges ourselves, and</p>
			<p>(b) We see people on forums asking these questions over and over.</p>
			<p>
				It’s <span class="underline">the same</span> set of questions from
				<span class="underline">everyone</span>, and they can take
				<span class="underline">weeks or months</span> to discover the answers to.
			</p>
			<p>
				It doesn’t take that long because you <span class="underline">can’t find the answer</span> either.
			</p>
			<p>
				It takes some people <span class="underline bolded">months</span> to make these decisions about
				how to proceed because…
			</p>
			<p>1. They want to make the best decision for their future.</p>
			<p>
				The decision about where to start in software development has a hundred different answers.
			</p>
			<p>
				C#, C++, C, Python, JavaScript, Java (and what is the difference between the two?),
				TypeScript, PHP, Kotlin, Scala, Haskell, Swift, Go, HTML, SQL, CSS…
			</p>
			<p>The options are <span class="underline">endless</span>.</p>
			<p>“Which one is the best for me?” you ask.</p>
			<p>
				In this guide, <span class="italics">we’ll tell you our answers</span> based on years of research
				and experience.
			</p>
			<p>2. They don’t know who to trust.</p>
			<p>There are a thousand people asking questions about how to start programming every day…</p>
			<p>And they all wonder:</p>
			<p>Can I trust the answer I received to my question?</p>
			<p>
				We wrote this guide because <span class="underline"
					>we were sure we had the right answer</span
				>
				and because
				<span class="underline">we made it to paid roles when 99% of others didn’t.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				We wanted to pass on our knowledge to people who were just like us back when we started. So
				we wrote this guide.
			</p>
			<p>3. They don’t know how to start learning.</p>
			<p>
				There are thousands of websites with “free” resources where <span class="underline"
					>you pay with time spent moving from resource to resource…</span
				>
			</p>
			<p>Trying to discover “the answer” to question after question…</p>
			<p>
				Should you use CodeCademy? Should you use The Odin Project? Should you make a video game, or
				a Machine Learning algorithm? What’s a good project for a beginner? Can a beginner handle
				this project?
			</p>
			<p>
				We made this guide because we understood <span class="underline">exactly</span> how to escape
				“Tutorial Hell” (because we’ve done it ourselves over and over)…

				text="We’ll give you our “All Questions Answered” Beginners Guide to Programming."
			/>
			<p>Because we were in exactly your position once not too long ago.</p>

			<p>
				And because we were in your shoes, we know some <span class="underline bolded"
					>software development secrets that Computer Science graduates don’t want you to know.</span
				>
			</p>

			<p>A bootcamp graduate paid $20,000 and four months of his life to land a paid role.</p>

			<p class="underline">We’ll help you do it for $89.</p>

			<p>
				A Computer Science Bsc graduate spent $40,000 and four years of his life to land a paid
				role.
			</p>

			<p class="italics">They want you to believe it’s impossible unless you’re a genius.</p>

			<p class="underline">We’ll tell you the truth:</p>

			<p>
				That software development can be <span class="underline">simple to learn</span> and is
				<span class="underline">entirely within your grasp</span> so long as you have:
			</p>

			<p>1. Moderate amounts of brains.</p>

			<p>2. Solid work ethic.</p>

			<p>3. Determination.</p>

			<p>
				We’re certain that anyone who has all three, or enough of them in some quantities, <span
					class="underline">can become a paid developer</span
				>.

				Think $87 is expensive? <span class="italics">Here’s what costs more:</span>
			</h3>

			<p>At $15.75 an hour, over 40 hours, you earn $630.</p>

			<p>But if you bump your pay up to $38/hour, you get $1,520 per week.</p>

			<p>
				That’s a difference of <span class="underline">$890 per week</span>
				after you get a job as a software developer.

			<p>
				Some software devs make <span class="underline">even more</span>
